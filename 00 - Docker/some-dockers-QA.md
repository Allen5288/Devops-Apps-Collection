# Docker QA

Here are Docker questions and their answers with one-line explanations in markdown format.

1. **Question:** You create a Dockerfile for an application that you are maintaining. You want to create a new container from this image. Select two commands that you will need to run to do this.
   **Answer:** `docker build -t image_name` and `docker run image_name`
   **Explanation:** Build the image, then run a container from it.

2. **Question:** Which of these advantages does Docker not provide over other approaches to containerization?
   **Answer:** provisioning virtual machines as code
   **Explanation:** Docker is for containers, not virtual machines.

3. **Question:** You want to start an instance of Portainer with Docker, and you want the container to be removed after you stop Portainer. Which two commands should you use? (Note: You do not need to know Portainer to answer this question.)
   **Answer:** `docker run --rm` and `docker container create --rm`
   **Explanation:** The `--rm` flag automatically removes the container on exit.

4. **Question:** What problem does Docker Compose aim to simplify?
   **Answer:** defining and running multiple containers that are related to each other
   **Explanation:** It simplifies managing multi-container applications.

5. **Question:** You have created a container image for your Node.js application and want to upload it to a private container registry. Which group of Docker CLI commands should you use? (Note: You do not need to know Node.js to answer this question.)
   **Answer:** `docker tag`, `docker login`, `docker push`
   **Explanation:** Tag the image, log in to the registry, then push the image.

6. **Question:** ______ define the resources your container can access on its host. ______ define how much of those resources you can consume.
   **Answer:** Namespaces; Quotas
   **Explanation:** Namespaces control access, quotas control limits.

7. **Question:** You want to list all of the containers that are currently running on your system, including stopped and exited containers. Which command should you run?
   **Answer:** `docker ps -a`
   **Explanation:** The `-a` flag shows all containers, regardless of status.

8. **Question:** You are attempting to start a container from the `nginx:latest` container image. You want to ensure that the container is deleted after the command executed by the image completes. Which command will help you accomplish this?
   **Answer:** `docker run --rm nginx:latest`
   **Explanation:** `--rm` removes the container after it stops.

9. **Question:** You attempt to create a container called `redis` with `docker run`. Unfortunately, while the `docker run` command is successful, the container exits immediately after starting. While troubleshooting, you run `docker logs redis` to view logs generated by the container. However, the command does not return anything. Why might this be happening?
   **Answer:** Redis exited before it could generate log messages.
   **Explanation:** The container exited too quickly to log anything.

10. **Question:** You are a web developer working on moving your company's website into Docker. You want to make the website and its assets available to the container. You do not want the files to be bundled into this container's container image. You also want the application to start once the container is created. How can you do this?
    **Answer:** `docker run -v`
    **Explanation:** Use the `-v` flag to mount a volume.

11. **Question:** You maintain a three-tier web application. You want to run the web server, application layer, and database as containers with one tool and one command. How can you do this with the least amount of work?
    **Answer:** Define each component as a service in a Docker Compose YAML file.
    **Explanation:** Docker Compose efficiently manages multi-container apps.

12. **Question:** You create a Dockerfile based on the `nginx` image for your web-based application. However, upon building the image with `docker build`, you notice that the container image builds much more quickly than expected. The build succeeds, and the application works as expected upon starting a container from that image. What happened?
    **Answer:** You already built this image. The layers of this image were cached.
    **Explanation:** Docker's caching mechanism reused previous layers.

13. **Question:** Which of these commands can you execute to verify that Docker is working properly in your system?
    **Answer:** `docker run --rm hello-world`
    **Explanation:** This runs a simple test image and removes it.

14. **Question:** You are creating a Dockerfile for your Python application. You want containers created from this image to start your Python application immediately upon starting up. You also want to give users the ability to optionally supply command-line flags to the application through `docker run`. Which Dockerfile command should you run? (Note: You do not need to know Python to answer this question.)
    **Answer:** `ENTRYPOINT`
    **Explanation:** `ENTRYPOINT` sets the main command; `CMD` adds defaults.

15. **Question:** You have installed Docker Desktop on your MacBook and are now troubleshooting a slow container that you created earlier in the day. You want to see a list of processes running within the container and basic metrics for each process, like CPU and memory utilization. Because the image the container was created from does not include a shell, `docker exec` will not work here. What can you do?
    **Answer:** Run `docker top`.
    **Explanation:** `docker top` shows processes inside a container.

16. **Question:** Select two common ways of interacting with Docker.
    **Answer:** Docker Desktop and the Docker extension for Visual Studio Code
    **Explanation:** These are popular GUI and IDE integration methods.

17. **Question:** You are attempting to start a C# application inside of a container. The application reads data from the file `/work/store-report.csv` and performs business logic against it. However, you get the following error message upon starting the container: `/work/store-report.csv: File is a directory` The application runs correctly when it is run outside of the container. Select two likely causes of this behavior. (Note: You do not need to know C# to answer this question.)
    **Answer:** You actually mounted a directory and There is a bug in the application that makes it think that the file is a directory.
    **Explanation:**  Incorrect mount or application bug misinterpreting the file.

18. **Question:** Which statement must every Docker Compose file start with?
    **Answer:** `version`
    **Explanation:**  Specifies the Compose file format version.

19. **Question:** You are a developer working on a containerized and open-source C# application. You want to make your application available to everyone and are expecting your users to run the application in a container. How should you package and deploy your app?
    **Answer:** Build the application as a container image. Push the container image into Docker Hub.
    **Explanation:** Docker Hub is a public registry for easy access.

20. **Question:** You want to download the `nginx` container image. Which Docker command should you run?
    **Answer:** `docker pull nginx`
    **Explanation:** `docker pull` downloads images from registries.
